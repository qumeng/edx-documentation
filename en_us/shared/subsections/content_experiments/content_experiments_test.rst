Test Content Experiments
##########################################

You should test content experiments in your course before the course starts, to
ensure that content is delivered to experiment groups as you intended.

When you view a unit that contains a content experiment in the LMS Staff view,
you can select one of the experiment groups from a drop-down list. The unit
page then shows the content as the selected group of students sees it.

For example, in the following image, Group 0 is selected, and the HTML
component and video that is part of Group 0 is displayed.

You can change the experiment group selection to view the content that a
different experiment group of students sees.

.. note:: The example course content in this section uses content experiment
 terminology ("Welcome to Group A", for example) to make the functionality
 clear. Typically, you would not use terminology in course content that would
 make students aware of the experiment.
