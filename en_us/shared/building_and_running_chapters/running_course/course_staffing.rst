Staffing
##########################

You can designate a team of people to help you run your course. Two roles are
available to give your administrative team members access to different options
for working with students, grades, and other members of the staff.

* Staff

* Admin

You can assign these privileged roles when you work in either the LMS or in
Studio, and the users who have these roles can work on your course in Studio,
the LMS, and Insights. For more information on setting up a team in Studio, see
:ref:`Add Course Team Members`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course and to moderate
and manage its discussions by assigning other LMS roles. The beta testers and
discussion administrators must be enrolled in your course, but they do not need
to have the Staff or Admin role. For more information, see :ref:`Beta_Testing`
and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

****************************
Administrative Team Roles

To provide access to features on the LMS Instructor Dashboard, you assign the
Staff role or the Admin role.

Team members with the **Staff** role can complete these tasks.

* View the course before the Course Start Date. 

* Enroll and unenroll students.

* Access student grades.

* Reset student attempts to answer a question correctly.

* See course HTML errors.

* Send email messages to course participants.

Team members with the **Admin** role have access to all of the same options for
running the course as team members with the Staff role. They can also complete
these tasks.

* Add and remove Staff.

* Add and remove other Admins.

* Add and remove Beta Testers.

* Add and remove Discussion Admins, Discussion Moderators, and Discussion
  Community TAs.

.. note:: To moderate course discussions, team members must have one 
 of these discussion roles assigned to them in addition to the Staff or Admin
 role. For more information, see :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.
