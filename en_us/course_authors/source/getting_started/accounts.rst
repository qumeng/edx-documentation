Getting Started with edX
#############################

The following sections provide an introduction to edX and instructions for
getting started on edX websites.

* :ref:`edX.org and edX Edge`
* :ref:`Create an Account`
* :ref:`edX101_section`

This information is intended for course team members. You might want to include
the details about the registration process and password policies in your
communications with prospective students.

For information about enrolling students in a course, see
:ref:`enroll_student`.

.. _edX.org and edX Edge:

*************************
edX.org and edX Edge
*************************

To explore edX courses, you can register on edX.org_, edX Edge_,
or both. These sites are visually and functionally the same, but the content
and purpose are different.

* edX.org hosts massive open online courses (MOOCs) from edX institutional
  partners. To publish courses on edX.org, you must have an agreement with edX
  and specific approval from your organization. Courses on edX.org are publicly
  listed in the edX course catalog and are open to learners from around the
  world.

* EdX Edge is edX's more private site. Courses on Edge are not published on
  edX.org. Any member of a partner course team can create and publish courses,
  including test courses, on Edge without receiving approval from edX or a
  partner institution. 

  However, Edge does not have a course catalog, and courses cannot be found
  through search engines such as Google. Only learners whom you explicitly
  invite or who have the URL for your course can participate in your course on
  Edge. Note that you can invite an unlimited number of learners to participate
  in an Edge course.

  EdX Edge also hosts small private online courses (SPOCs).

.. note:: 
 All course data and accounts on Edge and edX.org are separate. If you want
 to use both edX.org and Edge, you must go through the registration process on
 both sites.

.. _Create an Account:

*************************
Create an Account
*************************

To get started, you create, or *register*, an account on edX.org or Edge.  

#. Go to the `edx.org registration`_ or `Edge registration`_ page.

#. Optionally, select **Facebook** or **Google** to use your Facebook or Google
   account to set up your edX account.

#. If you do not use Facebook or Google to create your account, in the
   registration form, enter your information in the fields that have an
   asterisk (*).

  .. note::  
   Learners will see the name that you enter in the **Public username** field,
   not the name in the **Full name** field.

  If you are at an edX partner institution, you should use your
  institutional e-mail address.

4. For edx.org, select  **I agree to the edX Terms of Service
   and Honor Code**, and then select **Create your account**.

   For Edge, select both **I agree to the Terms of Service** and **I agree
   to the Honor Code**, and then select **Create My Edge Account**.

5. In the activation email message, select the link to complete the activation.
   When your account has been activated, your browser opens to an "Activation
   Complete" page that contains a link to your dashboard.

You can modify your account information and reset your password from the
:ref:`account settings<SFD Account Settings>` page. Note that account settings
are available from the LMS and learner dashboard, not from Studio or the
Studio dashboard.

******************************
The edX Demo Course and edX101
******************************

EdX provides the `edX Demo course`_ and `Overview of Creating an edX Course`_
to help familiarize you with taking and creating edX courses.

* The edX Demo course allows new students to explore and learn how to take
  an edX course. We recommend that you become familiar with the way students
  experience an edX course before you begin building your first course.

  .. note::
    You can include information about the edX Demo course in your course
    materials, and recommend that new learners take the edX Demo course before
    proceeding with your course.

* Overview of Creating an edX Course is an example of a course built with
  Studio. It is a self-paced walk-through of planning, building, and running
  your own online course.
